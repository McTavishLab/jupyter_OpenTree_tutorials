    "\n",
    "A solution to this, is mapping taxon names to unique identifiers using the Open Tree Taxonomic Name Resolution Service (TNRS). There are a few options to use this service including via teh API, or the browser based bulk name mapping. The names of the taxa you will search for this tutorial were copied from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_birds_of_Georgia_(U.S._state) the folder named 'GA_waterfowl.txt'.\n",

    "*Try this*\n",

    "  * In the \"Mapping options\" section (bottom of the menu to the left):\n",
    "    - select 'Birds' to narrow down the possibilities and speed up mapping\n",
    "  * Click \"Map selected names\" (middle of the menu to the left).\n",
    "  * Exact matches will show up in green, and can be accepted by clicking \"accept exact matches\".\n",
    "  * Once you have accepted names for each of the taxa, click \"Save nameset...\", download it to your laptop, and extract (unzip) the files. You can take a look at the human readable version of the output at `output/main.csv`. `main.json` contains the the same data in a more computer readable format.\n",
    "  * Finally, transfer the `main.csv` file to the tutorial folder, so you can use it to get the tree for your taxa.\n",
