IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences Pyrigemmula_aurantiaca and Pyrigemmula_aurantiaca_Tl805448 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 sequence that is exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.


IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 116 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates and undetermined columns removed is printed to file ot_350Tr53297_updated_norepeats.fas.reduced


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs" 


Alignment has 116 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data
