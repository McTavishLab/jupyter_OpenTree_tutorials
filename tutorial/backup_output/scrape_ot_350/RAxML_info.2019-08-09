IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences Tl805448 and otuPS149 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 sequence that is exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.


IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 116 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

An alignment file with undetermined columns and sequence duplicates removed has already
been printed to file /home/ejmctavish/Desktop/WH2019/tutorial/scrape_ot_350/physcraper.fas.reduced


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs" 


Alignment has 116 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data
