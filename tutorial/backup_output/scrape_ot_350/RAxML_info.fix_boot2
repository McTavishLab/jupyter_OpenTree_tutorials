IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences Pyrigemmula_aurantiaca and Pyrigemmula_aurantiaca_Tl805448 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 sequence that is exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.


IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 116 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

An alignment file with undetermined columns and sequence duplicates removed has already
been printed to file ot_350Tr53297_updated_norepeats.fas.reduced
